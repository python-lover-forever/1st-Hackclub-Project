# Hackclub-Projects
This project is a basic ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulator created with Python.
It allows users to:

- Log in with a username and password. (username : ahmed Password : 1234)
- Check their account balance.
- Withdraw or deposit funds.
- Exit from the ATM securely.

Each user is authenticated through a preset dictionary that contains usernames and passwords.
It will also make sure the user cannot withdraw more than they have, showing an error if they do.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate:

- The usage of loops and conditionals.
- The authenticated safe action of user input.
- Basic bank operations simulation.
